"""Addresses on the app's backend, as the browser must use them.

Downloads, waveform data and layout pictures are served by the backend (``/_chipova/...``).
Behind re-ddns that is the page's own host; in a local run it is another port. Reflex knows
which (``getBackendURL``), so links are built in the browser from a path, the same way Reflex
builds its upload URLs (which also works in a production build, unlike code in ``call_script``).
